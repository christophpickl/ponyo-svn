OFFERED PROJECTS
=================================================

1.3 Kinect project: Self-Calibration of Several Depth Cameras
	We developped a system to detect and track people with several Kinect cameras.
	In order to enable cameras to collaborate, they need to be calibrated.
	Current calibration step requieres to put some markers in the scene.
	The goal of this project is to calibrate cameras without any markers.
	Given the depth captured by the cameras, the cameras should detect
	the ground plane and similar object to auto calibrate themselves.

1.5 Kinect project: Gesture Recognition
	A natural way of human-computer interaction is through gestures.
	Microsoft has recently offered to naviguate within the Xbox interface
	with natural gestures given the depth captured by their Kinect camera.
	The goal of this project is to develop similar algorithm to recognize
	natural gesture to naviguate within a database of media content. 

1.6 Kinect project: A Virtual Golf Teacher
	The aim of this project is to bring a personal instructor in every home.
	It is proposed to develop a virtual instructor to teach and enhance human gestures.
	The potential applications can be in arts as well as in sports.
	The trainee will perform the gestures of interest in front of a Kinect Camera
	and the Virtual Instructor (Artificial Intelligence) will give feedbacks.
	The first application will be to teach golf gestures. 

1.7 Kinect project: Face Recogntion in Dark
	Face recognition is widely used to enter secured sites.
	However, most of the algorithms are sensitive to the scene illumination and lighting conditions.
	The goal of this project is to recognize face regardless the lighting conditions.
	The noisy depth information captured by the Kinect will be used.
	The student will evaluate the performance of noisy 3D models to extract features and classify them.
