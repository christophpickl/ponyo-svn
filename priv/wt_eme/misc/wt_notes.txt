============================================

* gutes zitat (bleib bei den basics, die aber dafuer umso besser lernen):
	Forget about the “what ifs” and so-called set responses many often waste hours practising for. The basics are what we need to survive, so it’s the basics that we should be concentrating on, not just when we are training alone, but also when we have partners to train with. Instead of trying to get clever with fancy movements or experimenting with sequences that will never find a situation to be applied to, the intelligent Wing Chun practitioner should drill the basics of the system until they are as natural and automatic as breathing.
	Who cares if your friends think that you are spending too much time on the “simple” things, or that your techniques just aren’t “pretty” enough. When it’s all said and done, the house that remains standing after the storm is the one which has the best foundations under the ground, not the one that looks the flashiest up on top.

* wingtsun namensherkunft; lernen hoert niemals auf:
	So, once you "finish" the system, you have only completed your first cycle, and you go back to Siu Nim Tau and recognize, for the first time ever, how much of the most advanced concepts in WT are already in there. From there, with your new understanding of what is actually in these forms and how to apply it, you go back through Chum Kiu and Biu Tze, the Dummy and Weapons forms again, and again, developing an ever higher-level idea of what these are really all about. Naturally, this time, it won't take you five years to get through the cycle because you have long since become an instructor yourself.
	In the process of all this, you literally and truly make Wing Tsun a part of you. That process becomes an endless cycle. Every time you cycle through the system, you go one step higher - and higher - and higher still. It never stops.
	That's why it's called "wing tsun". That Chinese name for this art can be translated into English as "eternal springtime" or "forever young" because, as long as you practice it, you will never stop growing. You are always new, and so is your ever brand-new, personal brand of ... well, some call it "wing tsun" - but in the end, it's always just you.
	That is the Way of Wing Tsun. You are constantly learning to discover and then reinvent yourself.

WT principles [http://hopkinswingchun.wetpaint.com/page/Wing+Chun+Principles]

Wing Chun was designed to satisfy two primary objectives (in bold), through the use of a number of principles (in italics). To apply these principles, there are a number of requirements that the practioner must satisfy (underlined).

    Economise Time – The faster person wins.
        Reduce time needed while attacking
            Follow the straight line – the shortest path between two points
            Simultaneous Attack and Defense – twice the speed
                Attack down the Central line
                    Requires Ambidexterity 
        Reduce time needed while guarding
            Guard the Centerline, where most weaknesses are
                Keep your hands out in front of you and force your opponents to take the outside
                Keep your elbows in and use the concept of the four gates 
        Reduce reaction time
            Watch lead elbow and back knee
            Establishing bridge and relying on contact reflexes 
        Reduce time needed to initiate your move and recovery time afterwards
            Flow of movements – end of one movement is the start of another
            Short Movements – short power (tricep force) vs. long power
                Closest distance for fighting 
            Relaxed Movements – allows more rapid movements
                Use force only when necessary
                    Tighten fist only at the end 
    Economise Effort – Conserve your energy as much as possible. The less energy you use, the harder it is for the energy to be turned back on yourself.
        Reduce effort needed to execute individual movements
            Follow the path of least resistance – jammed hands move away, free hands move forward.
                Requires Sensitivity
                Requires Interruptibility
                Requires Ambidexterity 
            Make full use of available energy
                Make use of your body’s momentum
                    Synchronise the punch with the step 
            Make use of the opponent’s energy
            Do not use more energy than necessary
                Requires Control 
        Reduce effort needed to finish the whole fight
            End fight as quickly as possible
                Attack the most crucial areas (Effectiveness)
                    Go straight for the head, ribs, eyes, shin, 
            Deal irreversible damage
                Arm breaks, knee breaks and eye jabs 
            Do not use unnecessary movement
                Gyeuk Moh Hoy Fat – The kick never misses 
            Obtain positional advantage
                Take the outside
                Cramp taller people while keeping shorter people at bay
                Wing Chun blocks – use the body to create simple machines like the inclined plane, axes and levers to conserve energy instead of relying on generating momentum
                    Require Accuracy and Timing
