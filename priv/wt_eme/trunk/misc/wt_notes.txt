* gutes zitat (bleib bei den basics, die aber dafuer umso besser lernen):
	Forget about the “what ifs” and so-called set responses many often waste hours practising for. The basics are what we need to survive, so it’s the basics that we should be concentrating on, not just when we are training alone, but also when we have partners to train with. Instead of trying to get clever with fancy movements or experimenting with sequences that will never find a situation to be applied to, the intelligent Wing Chun practitioner should drill the basics of the system until they are as natural and automatic as breathing.
	Who cares if your friends think that you are spending too much time on the “simple” things, or that your techniques just aren’t “pretty” enough. When it’s all said and done, the house that remains standing after the storm is the one which has the best foundations under the ground, not the one that looks the flashiest up on top.

* wingtsun namensherkunft; lernen hoert niemals auf:
	So, once you "finish" the system, you have only completed your first cycle, and you go back to Siu Nim Tau and recognize, for the first time ever, how much of the most advanced concepts in WT are already in there. From there, with your new understanding of what is actually in these forms and how to apply it, you go back through Chum Kiu and Biu Tze, the Dummy and Weapons forms again, and again, developing an ever higher-level idea of what these are really all about. Naturally, this time, it won't take you five years to get through the cycle because you have long since become an instructor yourself.
	In the process of all this, you literally and truly make Wing Tsun a part of you. That process becomes an endless cycle. Every time you cycle through the system, you go one step higher - and higher - and higher still. It never stops.
	That's why it's called "wing tsun". That Chinese name for this art can be translated into English as "eternal springtime" or "forever young" because, as long as you practice it, you will never stop growing. You are always new, and so is your ever brand-new, personal brand of ... well, some call it "wing tsun" - but in the end, it's always just you.
	That is the Way of Wing Tsun. You are constantly learning to discover and then reinvent yourself.
