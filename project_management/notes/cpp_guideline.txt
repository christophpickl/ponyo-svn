Exception Handling
=================================================
Guidelines for throwing:
- Use exceptions only to report errors, not as general control structures
- Throw exceptions only when the error cannot be handled locally
- Also throw exceptions in library code: the host application wants to control the user output (imagine std::vector would write something to std::cerr when an error occurs instead of throwing a std::out_of_range)
- Never allow an exception to leave a destructor

Guidelines for catching:
- Never allow an exception to leave a destructor
- Assume that an exception that can be thrown will be thrown
- When writing "real" applications, design for exception safe code - don't make it an "afterthought"
- Writing exception safe code doesn't mean 'try'-ing. Learn what code can throw and what the effects would be if an exception was thrown at any given location.
